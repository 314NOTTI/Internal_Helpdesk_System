# Internal Helpdesk System

Backend API for an internal helpdesk system, developed as a portfolio project.

This project was inspired by real-world experience in IT support environments, where ticket systems play a key role in organizing demand, tracking workload, and supporting management decisions such as time allocation and volume of requests handled by the team.

🚧 This project is a work in progress 🚧
